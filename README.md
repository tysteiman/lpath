# lpath
A wrapper around viewing files in your path with less

## Usage
You can access the script however you want, as a binary or symlink.

Assuming lpath is in your PATH you can call `lpath <file/command>` to open the file in less.

### Example
`lpath rake`

This will less the results (file path) of `which rake`.
